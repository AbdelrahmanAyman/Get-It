# Get It
A native macOS video/audio downloader. Think of it as a youtube downloader that works on many sites.

# Installation

Download it [here](https://github.com/Kevin-De-Koninck/Get-It/releases/download/v0.6/Get.It.app.zip), unzip it and open it.
If a yellow package button is visible on the main screen, click on it and follow the guide (to install the dependencies).


# About

Get It will download audio and/or movies from many websites such as YouTube, BBC, Instagram, ... It's a GUI round the popular YouTube-DL command-line program but with an easy to use interface.
It will save your settings dynamically or you can restore the default settings. The default settings will download the audio from a video, convert it to an MP3 and save it to you downloads folder. This was, in my opinion, the mostly used setting.


# Installation Guide

Get It will check if the dependencies that it needs are installed. If not all dependencies are installed, there will be a package icon in the main window that you can click. This button will load a simple installation guide that will guide you through the installation of the missing dependencies. If a dependency is already installed on your Mac, than the guide will not show this to avoid over complicating it.
the following image is a screenshot of a step in the installation guide:
