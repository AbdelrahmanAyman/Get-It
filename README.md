# YouTube-dl-GUI (OLD name, to be updated)
A GUI (OSX) for the [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) command.

I've created this program without any experience in app development. The coding can be a bit dirty... I'll update this when I got some more time. But for now, it does what I want it to do :)
